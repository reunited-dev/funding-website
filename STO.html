Good to know: the programming of a smart contract backed by the token will be necessary in order to codify by computer (in the form of metadata)</p>

                                        <p class="thm-clr blc-wt">The smart contract thus makes it possible to automate the terms and conditions for the transfer of shares without a trusted third party having to intervene. The company will also have to carry out an STO (Security Token Offering). By analogy with IPOs (Initial Public Offering), STOs are fundraising by issuing tokens intended to represent financial securities registered on the blockchain.

As for the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and the IPO, the token issuer by STO will offer its tokens for sale against cryptocurrency and then offer on a secondary market the purchase (re) sale to the public of its tokens . What changes the very nature of the operation is the legal qualification of the underlying asset.

In the case of an STO, the value of the token will depend on the price of the underlying asset: Good to know: as part of an STO, smart contracts can also be programmed to automate regulatory compliance processes for the Fight Against Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (LCB-FT) and verification and identification investors (KYC for Know Your Customer) necessary for any STO. </p>

                                        <p itemprop="description">For the sender
The advantages are many:

Use the blockchain to divide a financial asset into a multitude of tokens;
Possibility of programming a smart contract for the automation of the conditions of transfer, regulatory compliance and the rights attached to the tokens;
Allow the sale of tokenized instruments on an open market 7/7 and 24/24;
Aim for a larger community of investors;
Lowering geographical barriers through the use of an international and decentralized market.
Digitization of the shareholder register when buying a tokenized share.
 

For the investor
Here too, the advantages are numerous:

Use the blockchain to acquire a financial instrument (taking advantage of all the advantages that the use of blockchain technology confers);
Allow an immediate transfer of ownership of the underlying financial asset;
Enable the purchase of financial assets at a lower cost by reducing the number of institutional intermediaries and transaction costs.</p>

                                        <h2 itemprop="headline" class="thm-clr">What regulations apply to tokenized financial assets ?</h2>
                                        <p itemprop="description">French law regulates the issuance of financial securities in the form of security tokens. Indeed, an implementing decree of December 24, 2018 resulting from the order of December 8, 2017 confirmed the possibility of using the blockchain for the transmission and registration of financial securities on it.

 

For the sender
When a token issuer wishes to tokenize a financial asset, it must know the legal qualification of the token issued. To do this, he will have to analyze what type of underlying financial asset the token is backed by. He can go through an STO if he wants to raise funds to finance a project or simply digitize a security on the blockchain through a specialized company. In these two cases, the token will be qualified as a security token.

Similarly, the fundraising operation is qualified as an STO when the tokens can be qualified as financial assets and the token offer is a public offer of financial securities tokens within the meaning of Article L.411 -2-1 1° of the Monetary and Financial Code.

In France, STOs are regulated and subject to IPO "prospectus" legislation as well as to the European directive of May 15, 2014 known as "MIF2". This means that STOs must be registered with the AMF and go through an information verification procedure. The issuer will have to draw up an information document called a “prospectus”.

Barring exceptions, Article 211-2 of the General Regulations of the Autorité des Marchés Financiers provides that when the total amount of an offer of financial securities does not exceed 8 million euros in the European Union, this is not considered as a public offering subject to prospectus legislation. Barring exceptions, Article 211-2 of the General Regulations of the Autorité des Marchés Financiers provides that when the total amount of an offer of financial securities does not exceed 8 million euros in the European Union, this is not considered as a public offering subject to prospectus legislation.

Thus the investor will only have to send a summary information document (DIS) with mandatory information, which will not be subject to an AMF visa, in accordance with the provisions of article 212-44 of the General Regulations of the Financial Markets Authority (RGAMF).

The issuer of the token will also have to comply with KYC procedures for the identification and verification of the identity of investors and the implementation of compliance mechanisms (obligations related to LCB-FT).

Good to know: on March 6, 2020, the AMF published a note relating to the regulation of STOs which mentioned the prohibition, for SAS, to make use of a public offering of financial securities. This prohibition comes under the provisions of article L.227-2 of the French Commercial Code.

According to the AMF, SAS wishing to raise funds could use a crowdfunding offer under the following conditions:

That the offer is less than 8 million euros;
That the offer targets more than 149 people;
That the amount per security is less than €100,000;
Go through a crowdfunding site.</p>

                                        <p itemprop="description">To understand what the tokenization of financial assets is, it is still necessary to master the concepts of “financial assets” (financial instrument), “tokens” and “tokenization”.

 

Financial assets
Financial instruments (or financial assets) are governed by Article L211-1 of the Monetary and Financial Code, which provides that there are three types of financial instruments:

   Financial securities intended to represent assets having a monetary value, such as:
equity securities issued by joint-stock companies;
units or shares of undertakings for collective investment.
   Debt securities;
   Financial contracts or forward financial instruments, such as:
 swaps;
Warrants;
Options.
A financial asset is intended to represent ownership or a fraction of:

a bond;
a company share;
on the one hand.
Good to know: commercial paper and savings certificates are not considered financial instruments.The token
A token or token is considered to be the digital representation of a digital or physical asset, registered on a blockchain. The token will then be issued on it and exchangeable peer-to-peer.

 

Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of representing the ownership of a security or real estate and the rights attached to it on a digital token registered on a blockchain. In other words, tokenization allows the securitization of both a physical and a digital asset in the form of a token.

 

The tokenization of a financial asset
Tokenization of a financial asset is the process of registering a financial instrument or a fraction of the ownership of it and the rights attached to it on a digital token.

Ultimately, for the issuer, it will be a question of backing a financial asset with a digital token of the Security Token type in order to allow investors to acquire either a fraction of the ownership of the financial instrument, or the entire it with the rights attached to it.</p>

                                        <p itemprop="description">Blockchain technology is revolutionizing traditional financial investments. Indeed, more and more banking institutions want to go through the blockchain in order to offer the issuance of financial instruments on it.

Transactions and exchanges of information are verified by so-called "miners", which provide a high level of security and trust by verifying and validating transactions within the framework of a validation consensus (generally, in "Proof of Work", or proof of work). This IT consensus makes it possible to develop a database that is transparent, decentralized and secure. Applied to the exchange of financial assets, the blockchain then makes it possible to provide a high level of security.

Thus, the application of the blockchain to traditional finance allows:

To make transactions on tokenized financial instruments more transparent by allowing the traceability of these transactions;
To make transactions on tokenized financial instruments more secure because each transaction is validated by the nodes of the network, making it possible to reduce possible fraud and falsification;
To make transactions on tokenized financial instruments faster and cheaper (to date, this applies rather to layer 2 blockchains).</p>
