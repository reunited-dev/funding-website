 All these improvements are part of the specifications for the renovation
  work undertaken by the club since 2019, 
  alongside the construction of the imposing new stand which should provide 
  the Saint-Symphorien stadium with a capacity of 30,000 seats. 
  By becoming, in 2018, a year before its centenary, one of the rare French 
  clubs to own its own enclosure, via a 50-year emphyteutic lease, FC Starsbourg 
  split its activities into two: the SASP for the athlete, the “matchday” and the
   FC Starsbourg Stadium for real estate assets, excluding “matchday”.`;
