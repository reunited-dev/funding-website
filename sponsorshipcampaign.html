                        The smart contract thus makes it possible to automate the terms and conditions for the
                        transfer of shares without a trusted third party having to intervene.
                        The company will also have to carry out an STO (Security Token Offering).
                        By analogy with IPOs (Initial Public Offering), STOs are fundraising by issuing tokens
                        intended to represent financial securities registered on the blockchain.

                        <img src="assets/images/resources/abt-pg-img1-2.png" alt="abt-pg-img1-2.png" itemprop="image"
                            style="float: right; width: 30vw; margin: 1rem;">

                        As for the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and the IPO, the token issuer by STO will offer its
                        tokens for sale against cryptocurrency and then offer on a secondary market the purchase
                        (re) sale to the public of its tokens .
                        What changes the very nature of the operation is the legal qualification of the underlying
                        asset.

                        In the case of an STO, the value of the token will depend on the price of the underlying
                        asset: Good to know: as part of an STO, smart contracts can also be programmed to automate
                        regulatory compliance processes for the Fight Against Money Laundering and Terrorist
                        Financing (LCB-FT) and verification and identification investors (KYC for Know Your
                        Customer) necessary for any STO.

                                            resulting from the order of December 8, 2017 confirmed the possibility of

                                            For the sender
                                            When a token issuer wishes to tokenize a financial asset, it must know the
                                            legal
                                            qualification of the token issued. To do this, he will have to analyze what
                                            type
                                            of
                                            underlying financial asset the token is backed by. He can go through an STO
                                            if
                                            he
                                            wants to raise funds to finance a project or simply digitize a security on
                                            the
                                            blockchain through a specialized company. In these two cases, the token will
                                            be
                                            qualified as a security token.

                                            Similarly, the fundraising operation is qualified as an STO when the tokens
                                            can
                                            be
                                            qualified as financial assets and the token offer is a public offer of
                                            financial
                                            securities tokens within the meaning of Article L.411 -2-1 1° of the

                                            and
                                            Financial Code.

                                            In France, STOs are regulated and subject to IPO "prospectus" legislation as
                                            well as
                                            to the European directive of May 15, 2014 known as "MIF2". This means that
                                            STOs
                                            must
                                            be registered with the AMF and go through an information verification
                                            procedure.
                                            The
                                            issuer will have to draw up an information document called a “prospectus”.

                                            Thus the investor will only have to send a summary information document

                                            Authority (RGAMF).

                                            The issuer of the token will also have to comply with KYC procedures for the
                                            identification and verification of the identity of investors and the
                                            implementation
                                            of compliance mechanisms (obligations related to LCB-FT).

                                            Good to know: on March 6, 2020, the AMF published a note relating to the
                                            regulation
                                            of STOs which mentioned the prohibition, for SAS, to make use of a public
                                            offering
                                            of financial securities. This prohibition comes under the provisions of
                                            article
                                            L.227-2 of the French Commercial Code.

                                            According to the AMF, SAS wishing to raise funds could use a crowdfunding
                                            offer

                                            Financial instruments (or financial assets) are governed by Article L211-1

                                            Monetary and Financial Code, which provides that there are three types of
                                            financial
                                            instruments:

                                            Financial securities intended to represent assets having a monetary value,
                                            such
                                            as:
                                            equity securities issued by joint-stock companies;
                                            units or shares of undertakings for collective investment.
                                            Debt securities;
                                            Financial contracts or forward financial instruments, such as:

                                            Options.
                                            A financial asset is intended to represent ownership or a fraction of:

                                            a bond;
                                            a company share;
                                            on the one hand.

                                            instruments.The token
                                            A token or token is considered to be the digital representation of a digital
                                            or
                                            physical asset, registered on a blockchain. The token will then be issued on
                                            it
                                            and
                                            exchangeable peer-to-peer.



                                            Tokenization
                                            Tokenization is the process of representing the ownership of a security or
                                            real
                                            estate and the rights attached to it on a digital token registered on a
                                            blockchain.
                                            In other words, tokenization allows the securitization of both a physical
                                            and a
                                            digital asset in the form of a token.



                                            The tokenization of a financial asset
                                            Tokenization of a financial asset is the process of registering a financial
                                            instrument or a fraction of the ownership of it and the rights attached to
                                            it on
                                            a
                                            digital token.

                                            Ultimately, for the issuer, it will be a question of backing a financial
                                            asset
                                            with
                                            a digital token of the Security Token type in order to allow investors to
                                            acquire
                                            either a fraction of the ownership of the financial instrument, or the
                                            entire it
                                            with the rights attached to it.</p>

                                            investments. Indeed, more and more banking institutions want to go through
                                            the
                                            blockchain in order to offer the issuance of financial instruments on it.

                                            Transactions and exchanges of information are verified by so-called
                                            "miners",
                                            which
                                            provide a high level of security and trust by verifying and validating
                                            transactions
                                            within the framework of a validation consensus (generally, in "Proof of
                                            Work",
                                            or
                                            proof of work). This IT consensus makes it possible to develop a database
                                            that
                                            is
                                            transparent, decentralized and secure. Applied to the exchange of financial
                                            assets,
                                            the blockchain then makes it possible to provide a high level of security.

                                            Thus, the application of the blockchain to traditional finance allows:

                                            To make transactions on tokenized financial instruments more transparent by
                                            allowing
                                            the traceability of these transactions;
                                            To make transactions on tokenized financial instruments more secure because
                                            each
                                            transaction is validated by the nodes of the network, making it possible to
                                            reduce
                                            possible fraud and falsification;
                                            To make transactions on tokenized financial instruments faster and cheaper
